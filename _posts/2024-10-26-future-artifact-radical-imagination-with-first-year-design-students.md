I recently had the incredible opportunity to share the "Future Artifact" framework, a process of radical imagination, with first-year design students at the Institute of Arts and Design in São Paulo (IAD), thanks to an invitation from Professor Grazi. Grazi teaches students across various design disciplines—graphic, digital, product, and fashion—and it was truly inspiring to witness these young creatives dive into the depths of imagination and speculative design.

The session began with a three-hour workshop aimed at sparking new perspectives. With around 40 students, all around 20 years old, we delved into the concept of "Future Artifact." The approach invites students to choose a meaningful personal object and explore its emotional significance, history, and potential future transformations. Through this, they create artifacts that reflect personal and societal narratives—radical not in the sense of being extreme, but rooted in their own lives and in the research of the past.
