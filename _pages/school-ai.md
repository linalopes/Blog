Welcome to an AI laboratory where machines learn to imagine.

This space documents experiments in AI and Machine Learning for
Creative Practices: from hand-gesture robots to generative art,
from interactive installations to speculative narratives.

Here, AI is a co-pilot for radical imagination. Some projects work
perfectly. Others break beautifully. All explore what happens when
real creativity meets artificial intelligence.
